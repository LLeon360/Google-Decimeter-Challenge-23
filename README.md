# Google-Decimeter-Challenge-23
## Blurb
**Goal of the Competition**

The goal of this competition is to determine the limit of smartphone GNSS positioning accuracy: that could be down to the decimeter or even centimeter level. You will develop a model based on raw GNSS measurements from Android phones.

Your work will help produce better positions, bridging the connection between the geo-spatial information of finer human behavior and mobile internet with improved granularity. Additionally, the more precise data could lead to new navigation methods.
